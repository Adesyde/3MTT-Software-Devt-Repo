        <p>Hi! I am Saheed Adeyanju, A dedicated and vibrant learner. October 2024, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering at Federal University of Technology Akure, Ondo State. My unrelenting passion for Mathematics and engineering has been a great motivation and has ignited the passion for computer programming, while in my leisure time, i enjoy writing code. additionally, I prioritize improving my typing skill currently achieving 60 WPM which has greatly streamlined my coding process. I discovered the 3MTT initiative during my final year and immediately recognized it as the structured learning opportunity I had been seeking. I am highly motivated to complete all assigned projects and contribute to the overall success of this course. Thank you.
